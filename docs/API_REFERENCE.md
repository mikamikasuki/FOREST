# FOREST HTTP API reference

The dashboard and CLI use the same `/api` endpoints and saved project state.
Use this reference to replace frontend screens without duplicating research
logic, execution state or manuscript data in the UI. The live contract is
available at `/openapi.json`, with interactive documentation at `/docs` and
`/redoc`. Checked-in contracts and the TypeScript client are described in
[API contract maintenance](API_CONTRACTS.md) and the
[frontend integration guide](FRONTEND_API_GUIDE.md).

## Transport and authentication

- The default local API origin is `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. A development frontend
  proxies `/api` and `/ws` to the API; production serves the built frontend from
  the same origin. There is no version prefix or universal `{data: ...}` wrapper.
- JSON operations use `Content-Type: application/json`. Upload and project import
  use `multipart/form-data` with a `file` field; let the browser set its boundary.
- Every existing successful HTTP operation returns `200`, including creation and
  task submission. A returned run is a queued/persisted execution record, not its
  eventual result. Lists are bare arrays unless the individual endpoint says
  otherwise. Binary exports and SSE must not be read with `response.json()`.
- Protected `/api` requests accept `Authorization: Bearer <owner-token>` or the
  `forest_owner` cookie. The owner token is a FOREST credential, not a model API
  key. `/api/auth/login` sets an HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie for 14 days;
  HTTPS adds Secure. API requests from a real loopback peer to a trusted hostname
  can establish the owner cookie without an existing token. Both the peer and
  hostname conditions must match; the OpenAPI empty security alternative is
  restricted by `x-forest-local-owner-access`.
- `/api/health`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/status` and GET share snapshots are
  public. DELETE share revocation still requires an existing valid owner cookie
  or bearer token. Public share snapshots expose only the selected display/status
  fields. Public-prefix middleware behavior does not authorize writes.
- On protected endpoints a supplied Origin must have a trusted hostname or match
  the request hostname; otherwise the API returns `ORIGIN_DENIED`. This is the
  existing same-origin policy, not a configurable permissive CORS layer.
- Provider/host/Agent configuration and scientific `data` fields are extensible
  objects. A component's documented properties are the known fields, not a list
  of every possible experimental payload. Persisted status/type strings remain
  open unless the existing validator explicitly defines an enum.

## Revision domains and editable paths

| Operation | `expected_revision` compares | When omitted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Graph preview/commands | Project graph revision | Required by GraphCommand |
| Graph batch | Project graph revision | Rejected by revision comparison |
| Project PATCH, node PATCH, idea adoption, proposal application | Project graph revision | Use the current revision |
| Generic resource PATCH, figure revision | That resource's revision | Use the current revision |
| Manuscript PATCH, compile, revise, export | PaperDocument revision | Use the current revision |
| Manuscript figure insertion, layout, review application | PaperDocument revision | Rejected by revision comparison |
| File PUT | That path's FileRevision | Accept current file revision |

Node revision identifies the version used by a run; it is not the graph edit
guard. Keep project, node, resource, paper and file revision values separate in
frontend state. On `409`, refresh the applicable record, preserve unsaved edits,
and let the user merge/reapply them. Do not silently overwrite the refreshed
state or replay a rejected semantic edit against an unrelated revision.

Graph commands support `add_node`, `edit_node`, `delete_node`, `add_dependency`,
`remove_dependency`, `fork_branch`, `clone_subtree`, `insert_before`,
`insert_after`, `reparent_subtree`, `merge_branches`, `split_node`, `group_nodes`,
`prune_branch`, `restore_branch`, `set_main_branch`, `apply_instruction_patch`,
`undo` and `redo`. `targets` contains existing node IDs; branch operations can
select `params.branch_id`. `params` is operation-specific. Preview returns impact
only; command application returns the updated graph, impact and scheduling IDs.
Inspect `conflicts`, `input_bindings_required`, `actions`, `rerun_nodes` and
`refresh_nodes` before presenting an edit as complete. `run:true` requests
scheduling, not a synchronous experiment.

| Graph operation | Target / main `params` fields | Resulting editable operation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `add_node` | Node fields directly or `node:{...}`, optional branch_id/parent_id | Add a node and optional execution parent |
| `edit_node` | targets: node IDs; fields directly or `patch:{...}`; optional stop_current_run | Deep-merge editable fields, analyze impact, optionally cancel the current run |
| `apply_instruction_patch` | targets: node IDs; instructions or old_text/new_text | Replace instructions or one exact matching passage |
| `delete_node` | targets; strategy subtree/reconnect/visual_only when descendants exist | Remove a subtree, reconnect execution reachability, or remove visual grouping |
| `add_dependency`, `remove_dependency` | source/target or two targets; relation; add supports input_mapping | Add/remove the specified typed edge |
| `fork_branch`, `clone_subtree` | origin target; optional name/node_ids/include_descendants/destination_branch_id/copy_policy | Clone selected nodes into a new or existing branch; create workspace only for a new branch |
| `insert_before`, `insert_after` | pivot target; node fields in node or selected direct fields | Insert a step and reconnect execution edges |
| `reparent_subtree` | pivot target; parent_id or new_parent_id; move_to_branch/input_map | Move execution parent and explicitly repair/review affected input bindings |
| `merge_branches` | left/right or left_branch_id/right_branch_id; name/resolution/dependencies | Compare and explicitly merge source workspaces/configuration into a new branch |
| `split_node` | original target; parts array of at least two node objects | Create a sequence, archive the original and flag dependent output rebinding |
| `group_nodes` | selected targets; optional group_id/title/collapsed | Create an editable display group without an experiment |
| `prune_branch`, `restore_branch`, `set_main_branch` | params.branch_id or a node target's branch | Change branch scheduling/active/main state |
| `undo`, `redo` | Current expected_revision; no target needed | Restore an editable graph history snapshot |

Fork copy_policy supports code/data/results strategies copy/reference/exclude
(booleans map to copy/exclude) and max_copy_bytes, default 100 MiB. Default file
policy copies code, references data and excludes results. Saved node result
handling also depends on the requested result copy policy; copied/reference
results do not establish fresh execution. Merge resolution.files maps paths to
left/right/base/delete or `{content:"..."}`; resolution.config is left/right or
an explicit configuration object. Missing merge choices return conflicts. A
missing editable fork base uses two-way comparison instead of inventing a base.

`depends_on` and `consumes` are execution relations. Typed evidence/citation/history
relations have different propagation duties. Kernel input bindings can create
execution dependencies even when no explicit canvas edge is drawn; the frontend
must preserve `inputs`, verification configuration and edge `input_mapping`.
Graph/branch/history edits remain editable. Undo changes graph content; it does
not undo completed processes, filesystem writes or external effects.

API file/artifact views use paths relative to their PROJECT root. Explicit node
`InputReference.path` instead uses its source BRANCH workspace unless
`project_scope:true`; `branch_id`/`node_id` select that actual source. Its
`destination` is relative to the receiving run workspace. Preserve these path
coordinates when moving a node or designing a file picker. `Branch.workspace` is
a project-relative directory; task `output_path` points to the run folder. Download
paths must be URL-encoded, not joined to a frontend filesystem directory.
`/projects/{id}/file` edits UTF-8 text; `/download` handles images/PDFs/binary files.
Working `paper/paper.tex` and `paper/references.bib` edits synchronize the saved
manuscript and invalidate its previous layout/compilation state.

## Submission IDs and state refresh

Graph command receipts are deduplicated by `(project_id, request_id)` before a
new command is applied. Batch commands use the same receipt namespace. Generic
scheduler submissions also use project request IDs. Keep an ID for transport
retries of the same submission and use a fresh ID for changed intent. Some
handlers compare payloads on replay (repository, verifier and layout submission);
do not assume every generic task checks payload equality. Idea adoption uses an
adoption receipt prefix. Node PATCH creates its own request ID and is not a
client-controlled idempotent graph-command replay.

Subscribe to project events after loading authoritative state. A notification is
a refresh/invalidation signal, not a complete replacement for the project/run/
resource. Re-fetch the affected records. Poll or reconnect for runs even if a
frontend component is remounted; never infer completion from a closed terminal.
Null timestamps, PID, exit code, error, session or spending limit mean no current
value. An unmeasured/null trial value is not a zero score.

## Errors

Application errors normally have:

```json
{"detail":{"code":"REVISION_CONFLICT","message":"Project changed","retryable":false,"suggestion":""}}
```

`suggestion` and context fields are optional. Graph kernel codes use lower case
(for example `revision_conflict`) and can include `expected_revision` and
`current_revision` directly in `detail`. Request validation uses FastAPI's array:

```json
{"detail":[{"loc":["body","expected_revision"],"msg":"Field required","type":"missing"}]}
```

Read either shape. Use HTTP status plus `detail.code` when it exists; do not
assume every `422` is a Pydantic array or every error code is upper case.
`retryable:true` describes a returned error, not blanket permission to repeat
state-changing requests with new IDs. Endpoint sections list their known domain
statuses. Unexpected handler/persistence/transport failures can return structured
`500 INTERNAL_ERROR`; documentation does not claim to replace runtime failures
with successful values.

## Scientific records and workbench fields

Generic resources are `library`, `experiments`, `datasets`, `ideas`, `theories`,
`claims`, `figures`, `analyses` and `reviews`. They share id/project_id/title/
revision/status/data/created_at/updated_at. Generic PATCH **shallow-merges** data;
an included nested value replaces that value. Generic POST creates metadata,
not execution. POST `/reviews` instead queues review work; there is no generic
review-create operation. Deleting a resource does not remove all its artifact
files. POST scientific actions return runs whose outputs create/update records.

### Figures and statistical presentation

`FigureRecord.data` separates `kind`, `run_ids`/`source_run_ids`, `metric`,
`purpose`, `caption`, `style`, actual `data`, `code`/`code_origin`, `outputs` and
`visual_selection`/`visual_review_status`. Preserve the complete object during
editing. The display style/code is not the statistical source data. `data` can
be a method topology/scene, per-object calibration predictions, or identified
statistical observations. The renderer chooses the applicable source and keeps
the result paths. The `outputs` object is a map of available export keys to
project-relative files; absent outputs are not downloadable formats.

A method `data` object retains supplied `nodes`/`edges`, optional `storyboard`/
`story_context`, and editable `production_scene`/`production_composition` plus
their source contracts and assets. Native scene objects include panels, objects,
connections and annotations. Pixel generation is a conceptual illustration path;
statistical plots/tables stay grounded in actual observations. Rendering does
not turn a schematic into measured evidence.

Figure revisions use `instruction` (singular), optional normalized
`region:{x,y,width,height}`, and the Figure resource revision. A selection made
against an older render must be refreshed before applying its revision request.
Image candidate reuse refers to a saved terminal figure run and real iteration
manifest; it is not a new invented image list. `visual_selection` can be null;
when present it identifies a candidate, complete ranking, reviewers and optional
placement. A whole-image raster completion can report `quality_status` and
`publication_gate_passed`; do not hide these behind a generic success label.

The statistical workflow preserves dataset/method/metric/condition/checkpoint
and independent seed/unit identities. Matching experiment declarations do not
establish source-bound verification. `comparison_eligible`, verification status
and numerical coverage stay distinct in trial displays. Paired inference is
computed by a queued analysis task over explicit real-data columns. Field units,
uncertainty definitions and publication table/curve output details are in
[statistical presentation](STATISTICAL_PRESENTATION.md).

### Manuscripts, layout and review proposals

The paper API accepts a PaperDocument ID or a project ID. GET can initialize the
first draft. `PaperRecord.data.source` and `bibtex` are the editable source;
`bindings`, `numeric_bindings`, `source_run_ids` and `figure_bindings` connect
scientific content to real evidence/artifacts. `pdf_path`/`source_dir` point to
actual files. `compiled_revision` must equal the enclosing paper revision for
current PDF export. Editing source invalidates `layout_plan`/`layout_preflight`,
which can be null. A previous PDF is not automatically the current draft.

The existing layout fields are columns, significant_digits, scientific_notation,
table_font_pt, min_font_pt, max_table_rows, float_placement, figure_span and
table_span. The component below gives their current values/bounds; the normalized
layout rejects unknown keys. `article` supports one/two columns; `iclr2027` uses
the template's single-column layout. Preserve layout decisions, visual placement
anchors and local references rather than regenerating a paper for UI changes.

Generated work can be automatically installed only when its saved paper
snapshot still matches and the manuscript has not been manually edited.
Otherwise a `ReviewRecord` with `kind:paper_generation` stores the entire
proposed bundle, diff and queued snapshot. Accepting it requires `indices:[0]`
and the current PaperDocument revision. Ordinary revision reviews contain exact
original/replacement spans; each original must occur once. A writing proposal
with `replacement:null` needs an evidence judgment and must not be applied as
deletion. Scientific review, literal writing review and compilation are distinct
operations.

### Repository and verification inputs

Repository input accepts **only** `url`, `ref`, `directory`, `transport` and
`credential`. It supports uncredentialed github.com HTTPS or git SSH URLs.
`ref` defaults HEAD, directory defaults source and transport defaults auto.
`credential` is a named worker profile, never an inline token, SSH key or host
credential path. SSH preparation requires a worker-side identity/known_hosts
profile. Submodule/depth/LFS fields are not accepted by the existing input.
Clone submission queues worker work; `/runs/{id}/repository` reports null until
the real provenance manifest exists. See [repository inputs](GITHUB_REPOSITORIES.md).

Verification submission accepts project_id, optional verification node/request
ID and the declared verification task configuration. Source identity/binding/
contract/verdict fields are service-owned. Producer verification views aggregate
current linked verifiers; changed files/configuration/node versions can revoke
prior acceptance. A completed run with `verification_status:unverified` is not
an accepted independent handoff. See [research workflow](RESEARCH_WORKFLOW.md).

### Protocol and publication fields

Base protocol validation requires research_question, hypothesis, baseline,
candidate, metric, statistical_unit, split_policy, selection_policy, decision_rule,
argumentative_duty, meaningful_effect and phase. Confirmatory phase requires
test_used_for_selection:false. A full_submission design also requires target_venue,
dataset_scale_rationale, baseline_selection_rationale, replicate_justification,
fair_compute_policy, leakage_checks, uncertainty_analysis, multiplicity_policy,
confirmation_policy, datasets/baselines/ablations with distinct IDs, distinct
integer seeds, studies covering all four argumentative duties and distinct
accepted_source_ids. The current editable profile determines coverage counts.
Structural validation does not run experiments or verify literature/claims.

Publication audit preserves ready/status/gaps, count/target/remaining-cell data
when available, and current independent verification. operational profile may
have no submission matrix. Route-health signals cover actual recorded repetition;
semantic scientific direction belongs to the queued full-history route review.
These views should stay independently inspectable after the UI is redesigned.

## Events and terminal transport

SSE endpoint `/api/projects/{id}/events` returns `text/event-stream`. It starts
with `event: connected` and `data: {}`. Persisted events use an integer sequence
as `id`, their saved type as the named event, and JSON `data`. Replay later
sequences with the `Last-Event-ID` header; invalid strings fall back to zero.
If the requested cursor predates retained history or is ahead of the latest
saved event, the stream emits a synthetic
`cursor_reset` control event with `id` set to `resume_after_sequence` and JSON
fields `requested_after_sequence`, `oldest_available_sequence`,
`latest_available_sequence`, and `resume_after_sequence`. Reread authoritative
REST state after this event; the stream then continues after the resume cursor.
With no saved events, an ahead cursor resets to checkpoint `0`.
Heartbeats are SSE comments, not
data events. Use EventSource with same-origin
cookies or a fetch-based streaming client capable of setting authentication and
cursor headers. Do not put owner tokens into query strings.

Terminal WebSocket `/ws/projects/{id}/terminal` authenticates with an owner
**cookie** or a real loopback peer; its handler does not read bearer headers.
A supplied Origin must be trusted or have the request hostname. Incoming/outgoing
messages are raw UTF-8 PTY text. Exact controls are
`{"resize":{"rows":40,"cols":120}}` (rows/cols clamped 1..1000) and
`{"action":"close"}`. The resize dispatcher uses the exact leading
`{"resize":`; preserve compact serialization. A reconnect can replay up to
131072 output characters. Session key is project/main branch; idle disconnected
sessions expire after approximately 1800 seconds. Close 1008 means auth/origin/
project rejection; 1013 means all 32 sessions are occupied. Terminal output is
separate from run stdout, process diagnostics and authoritative saved run state.

## Complete HTTP operation reference

Request schemas below retain the existing FastAPI/Pydantic rules for typed
bodies. Named schemas for untyped dictionaries describe intended successful
payloads and known keys; they do not add runtime validators. Optional-body
defaults and path/query defaults come from the actual registered route.

### Authentication

#### `POST /api/auth/login`

Compare body.token with the configured/generated owner token and set the forest_owner HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie for 14 days. HTTPS sets Secure. A supplied Origin must have the same hostname as the request. The token is never returned.

Body: `application/json`: `AuthLoginRequest`; required.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Authenticated`.

Known domain failures: `401` INVALID_TOKEN; `403` ORIGIN_DENIED.

#### `GET /api/auth/status`

Return whether the cookie or exact Authorization: Bearer <owner-token> matches. This public endpoint does not itself grant the trusted-loopback owner cookie.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Authenticated`.

### Configuration

#### `GET /api/agents`

Return a bare array of persisted Agent definition records.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Agent[]`.

#### `POST /api/agents`

Store name, role, instructions, optional provider, tools, config and enabled. Explicit Agent configuration records customized tools so default upgrades do not overwrite them.

Body: `application/json`: `AgentCreate`; required.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Agent`.

#### `PATCH /api/agents/{ident}`

Replace supplied known fields; config replaces the object. Custom tools remain marked customized. No revision guard.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |

Body: `application/json`: `AgentWrite`; required.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Agent`.

Known domain failures: `404` NOT_FOUND.

#### `GET /api/hosts`

Return a bare array of persisted execution host records.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Host[]`.

#### `POST /api/hosts`

Store name, kind and extensible execution configuration. This does not connect to the host; test it separately.

Body: `application/json`: `HostCreate`; required.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Host`.

#### `PATCH /api/hosts/{ident}`

Replace supplied name/kind/config and mark the connection untested.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |

Body: `application/json`: `HostWrite`; required.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Host`.

Known domain failures: `404` NOT_FOUND.

#### `POST /api/hosts/{ident}/test`

Local success is {connected:true,platform}; remote success is the RemoteRunner test result. Persist connected or failed. No experiment is launched.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |

Success `200`: `application/json`: `object`.

Known domain failures: `404` NOT_FOUND; `502` HOST_CONNECTION_FAILED.

#### `GET /api/providers`

Return a bare array of persisted provider records.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Provider[]`.

#### `POST /api/providers`

Accept ollama, openai-compatible or codex_cli kind and an HTTP(S) base_url. Codex CLI requires a localhost placeholder and the host's existing CLI login. Store a supplied api_key outside the returned provider; return has_key. Name/base_url/model are needed to create a usable record.

Body: `application/json`: `ProviderCreate`; required.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Provider`.

Known domain failures: `400` INVALID_PROVIDER or INVALID_URL.

#### `PATCH /api/providers/{ident}`

Replace supplied known fields; nonempty api_key updates the stored key. Empty/null api_key does not clear it. Mark status untested. This patch does not repeat create-time kind/URL validation.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |

Body: `application/json`: `ProviderWrite`; required.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Provider`.

Known domain failures: `404` NOT_FOUND.

#### `GET /api/providers/{ident}/models`

Return the provider response unchanged: Ollama normally uses {models:[...]}; OpenAI-compatible endpoints normally use {data:[...]}. Other JSON shapes remain provider-defined. This is a transport/list request, not a chat completion. Do not assume a normalized bare array.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |

Success `200`: `application/json`: `JsonValue`.

Known domain failures: `404` NOT_FOUND.

#### `POST /api/providers/{ident}/test`

Send a short JSON-status prompt through ModelClient. This DOES perform a model call and can consume tokens/cost. Persist connected/failed; success contains status plus extensible ModelClient result fields.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |

Success `200`: `application/json`: `object`.

Known domain failures: `404` NOT_FOUND; `502` PROVIDER_CONNECTION_FAILED (retryable).

#### `GET /api/providers/{ident}/usage`

Read configured-rate estimates and reservations across all projects using this provider. requests contains the 100 most recent records; request_count is the full count. Missing limit/remaining/individual estimate values are null, not zero.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |

Success `200`: `application/json`: `ProviderUsage`.

Known domain failures: `404` NOT_FOUND.

#### `GET /api/settings`

Return the saved extensible preference object, or language=en, theme=light, retention_days=30 and default_mode=assisted when no settings row exists.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `JsonObject`.

#### `PATCH /api/settings`

Shallow-merge arbitrary preference keys. No revision guard; nested values replace their previous values.

Body: `application/json`: `JsonObject`; required.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `JsonObject`.

#### `POST /api/settings/cleanup`

Delete terminal runs whose finished_at is older than the days cutoff and their output directories; mark dependent material stale. project_id optionally restricts run deletion. clear_edit_history applies to every project's graph history even when project_id is supplied.

Body: `application/json`: `CleanupRequest`; required.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `CleanupResult`.

### Events

#### `GET /api/projects/{ident}/events`

Server-Sent Events, not JSON. Begin with event: connected and data: {}. Persisted events include id: sequence, event: event.type and JSON data: event.data. Reconnect with Last-Event-ID to replay later sequences in batches of 100. If retained history starts after the requested cursor or the cursor exceeds the latest saved event, emit cursor_reset with id: resume_after_sequence and JSON requested_after_sequence, oldest_available_sequence, latest_available_sequence and resume_after_sequence; reread authoritative REST state, then continue from that ID. With no saved events, an ahead cursor resets to checkpoint 0. Invalid/missing cursor starts at zero and can also require this reset. Send a comment heartbeat roughly once per second; the stream ends on disconnect. Headers Cache-Control:no-cache and X-Accel-Buffering:no.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |
| `Last-Event-ID` | header | string | no | Last delivered integer sequence, encoded as a string. Missing/invalid values replay from zero; if retained events begin later or the cursor is ahead of the latest event, the stream emits cursor_reset and a resynchronization cursor. |

Success `200`: `text/event-stream`: `string`.

Known domain failures: `404` NOT_FOUND.

### Experiments

#### `GET /api/data/{ident}/rows`

ident resolves a TaskRun first, then an Analysis record (not a DatasetAsset ID). path defaults to run.output_path/predictions.csv or analysis.data.path. CSV/Parquet is fully read; filter is literal substring across cells and sort is an existing column. Return columns/selected rows/filtered total/origin. offset is clamped at zero; limit is capped at 1000. For bounded uploaded-table previews use /projects/{ident}/file/preview.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |
| `path` | query | string or null | no |  |
| `offset` | query | integer | no | Default `0`.  |
| `limit` | query | integer | no | Default `100`.  |
| `filter` | query | string | no | Default ``.  |
| `sort` | query | string | no | Default ``.  |
| `descending` | query | boolean | no | Default `False`.  |

Success `200`: `application/json`: `DataRows`.

Known domain failures: `403` PATH_ESCAPE; `404` NOT_FOUND or MISSING_ARTIFACT.

#### `POST /api/experiments/compare`

Require unique nonempty run_ids from one project; objective is optional. Check dataset/version, split, evaluation, metric, statistical unit, fair scientific budget and configured fields. Noncompleted/missing declarations are unverified; conflicting scopes are incomparable. Matching declarations are not independent evidence verification. config.provider_snapshot is omitted from compared rows.

Body: `application/json`: `ExperimentCompareRequest`; required.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `ExperimentComparison`.

Known domain failures: `400` CROSS_PROJECT; `404` NOT_FOUND; `422` INVALID_COMPARISON.

#### `POST /api/experiments/{ident}/launch`

Merge saved experiment data with the optional body, bind experiment_id/revision and optional associated node, and return Run. Body fields are experiment configuration overrides.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |

Body: `application/json`: `JsonObject`; optional.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Run`.

Known domain failures: `400` Scheduling/input errors; `404` NOT_FOUND.

#### `POST /api/projects/{ident}/protocol/validate`

Require the base protocol judgment/unit/selection/threshold fields. Confirmatory phase requires test_used_for_selection:false. A full_submission project additionally requires complete dataset/baseline/ablation/seed/study/accepted-source design and rationale fields. Return structurally_checked protocol/profile/scope; no experiment executes.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |

Body: `application/json`: `ProtocolRequest`; required.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `ProtocolResult`.

Known domain failures: `404` NOT_FOUND; `422` INVALID_PROTOCOL.

#### `POST /api/projects/{ident}/statistics/paired`

Require project-relative existing path and unit_column/baseline_column/candidate_column. Worker analysis_type=paired uses independent unit clusters; optional direction lower/higher, confidence, bootstrap_samples, seed and meaningful_effect configure the analysis. When required policy or an explicit verifier guard applies, path must select the uniquely admitted source-bound checked artifact or its verified graph input copy. Optional unguarded requests remain available. Return Run, not a confidence interval immediately.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |

Body: `application/json`: `PairedStatisticsRequest`; required.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Run`.

Known domain failures: `403` PATH_ESCAPE; `404` NOT_FOUND or MISSING_ARTIFACT; `422` MISSING_FIELD.

#### `POST /api/projects/{ident}/statistics/review`

Merge the extensible body, force review_scope=statistics and return queued Run. Optional request_id controls scheduler reuse; review findings arrive through saved run/resource output.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |

Body: `application/json`: `JsonObject`; optional.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Run`.

Known domain failures: `404` NOT_FOUND.

### Figures

#### `GET /api/figures/{ident}/export`

Query format defaults svg and indexes figure.data.outputs; available keys depend on the actual render. Return file bytes with filename figure.<format>. Missing output returns 409; do not infer that every figure supports every common format.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |

### Files

#### `POST /api/projects/import`

multipart/form-data file with forest-project-v1 manifest. Validate graph and archive paths, reject symlinks/path traversal and >500 MiB decompressed archives. Create a new project with remapped identifiers; active imported work is interrupted and execution is not replayed.

Body: `multipart/form-data`: `Body_import_project_api_projects_import_post`; required.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Project`.

Known domain failures: `400` INVALID_ARCHIVE, UNSAFE_ARCHIVE or graph validation errors; `413` UPLOAD_TOO_LARGE or ARCHIVE_TOO_LARGE.

#### `PUT /api/projects/{ident}/file`

FileWrite contains path/content and optional FILE expected_revision. Atomically replace file content, increment its revision, synchronize working manuscript files and mark consuming records stale. A first write to a missing path may use expected_revision=0; after deletion it advances that path's retained revision generation. Omitting expected_revision accepts the current revision.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |

Success `200`: `application/json`: `RunSession`.

Known domain failures: `404` NOT_FOUND.

#### `POST /api/runs/{ident}/{action}`

Actions: cancel, pause, resume, retry, skip, priority. retry requires a terminal run and returns a NEW Run. cancel is idempotent for terminal runs. pause accepts queued/waiting/budget_exhausted/running; resume accepts paused/waiting_input/waiting/budget_exhausted plus the documented legacy Agent context failure. skip accepts queued only. priority converts body.priority with int(). Resume can merge Agent budget and context_char_budget (integer >=1000). Return the persisted Run; process actions can fail with 409.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | path | string | yes |  |

Success `200`: `application/json`: `object`.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `SystemState`.

### Verification

#### `GET /api/runs/{ident}/verification`

For a verification run, return its current checks/verdict; for a producer run, return current linked verifier verdicts, accepted check paths and numerical scope. Configuration/artifact/node changes can invalidate prior acceptance. Status is independent of execution completion.

| Parameter | Location | Type | Required | Default / description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ident` | path | string | yes |  |

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Verification`.

Known domain failures: `404` NOT_FOUND.

#### `POST /api/verification/run`

Require string project_id. Optional node_id must be a verification-kind node in that project. Exclude project_id/node_id/request_id from task config and reject reserved service-owned identity/verdict fields. Reused request_id must have the same verifier/node/contract. Return Run with provider_snapshot/env/remote config entries omitted.

Body: `application/json`: `VerificationRequest`; required.

Success `200`: `application/json`: `Run`.

Known domain failures: `404` NOT_FOUND; `409` REQUEST_ID_CONFLICT; `422` INVALID_VERIFICATION or INVALID_CONFIGURATION.

## Request and response field definitions
